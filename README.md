### Fitness Tracker

TomFit is an application that will keep track of users daily fitness regimes and body composition. As a fitness enthusiast, I believe keeping track of workouts is a good way to further improve one's health and motivation.  As a user,

  * Keep track what exercises were performed and the duration.  
  * Record body composition and edit in changes as user progresses.
  * There will be fitness levels a user can choose from to tailor recommendations.
  * Pictures can be uploaded for user to see.
  * Public comment forum
  
## Technologies

React-native will be utilized for front-end rendering and making api calls to the backend server running Express.  Currently looking into which external api to use that best fits the app after I have an MVP.  

# Goals

To show potential employers my ability to learn languages on the fly and develop full stack applications.  I am currently learning React-native and hopefully be able to build out a working front end that is linked to a server by Wednesday.

# Challenges

I forsee quite a bit, just learning react native alone will be a huge one.  Though similar in ways to react.js, I still need to learn the nuances of the program and pull it all together with rails and external api calls.
